      The computing and information disciplines are relatively young. Yet despite their comparative youth,
      the computing and information disciplines have had an unparalleled effect on almost every aspect of
      contemporary life. Indeed it is difficult to predict the ultimate place of the computer in our world.
      It is the express purpose of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) to promote the computing and information disciplines
      and to encourage their contribution to the enhancement of knowledge. UPE was first organized at Texas A&M University,
      College Station, Texas, in 1967. The international organization now consists of chapters in various colleges and universities
      in North America and overseas. UPE is the first and only, existing international honor society in the Computing and Information disciplines.
      The mission of UPE is to recognize academic excellence at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in the Computing and Information Disciplines.
      UPE is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS).
